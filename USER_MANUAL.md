## Enhanced Pricing Management

### Understanding the Pricing System

The enhanced Custom Order Workflow includes a comprehensive pricing management system that provides complete visibility into cost components and profit calculations. This system is designed to help manufacturing teams accurately estimate costs while enabling sales teams to optimize pricing for maximum profitability.

#### Cost Breakdown Structure

Every item in a Pre-Quotation includes detailed cost breakdown across three main categories:

**Material Costs**: This represents the raw materials required to manufacture the item. The system considers material type, quantity, waste factors, and current market prices. For example, a wooden executive desk might include costs for wood panels, hardware, finishes, and adhesives.

**Labor Costs**: This encompasses all human resources required for manufacturing. The system calculates labor based on complexity, skill requirements, and estimated production time. Factors such as assembly complexity, finishing requirements, and quality control are automatically considered.

**Overhead Costs**: This includes facility costs, equipment depreciation, utilities, and administrative expenses allocated to each item. The system typically calculates overhead as a percentage of material and labor costs, with default rates that can be customized per company.

#### Automatic Calculations

The pricing system performs real-time calculations as you enter cost information:

**Total Cost Calculation**: The system automatically sums material, labor, and overhead costs to provide the total manufacturing cost per unit. This calculation updates instantly as you modify any cost component.

**Profit Margin Management**: You can set profit margins either as a percentage or by directly entering the desired selling price. The system automatically calculates the corresponding values and updates profit amounts in real-time.

**Quantity Calculations**: All pricing calculations automatically consider quantities, providing total costs, total selling amounts, and total profit for each line item.

### Using the Visual Selector

The visual selector revolutionizes how sales teams capture customer requirements by replacing complex forms with an intuitive point-and-click interface.

#### Getting Started with Visual Selection

When creating a new Pre-Quotation, the visual selector appears above the traditional items table. This interface guides you through a step-by-step process to capture all necessary specifications without requiring technical knowledge.

**Step 1: Category Selection**: Begin by clicking on the appropriate furniture category. The system displays visual representations of different furniture types including desks, chairs, cabinets, and specialized items. Each category is represented by clear, professional images that make selection intuitive.

**Step 2: Subcategory Refinement**: After selecting a category, choose the specific type of furniture. For example, if you selected "Desks," you might choose from Executive Desk, Conference Table, Workstation, or Reception Desk. Each subcategory includes typical specifications and standard dimensions.

**Step 3: Specification Entry**: The system presents a dynamic form tailored to your selected furniture type. For a desk, you might specify dimensions, material type, finish, special features, and hardware requirements. The form adapts based on your selections, showing only relevant options.

**Step 4: Quantity and Units**: Specify the quantity required and select the appropriate unit of measurement. The system supports various units including pieces, square meters, linear meters, hours, and days, depending on the item type.

**Step 5: Additional Notes**: Add any special requirements, customer preferences, or manufacturing notes that don't fit into the standard specification fields.

#### Advanced Visual Selector Features

**Template Application**: For common furniture types, you can apply pre-configured templates that automatically populate standard specifications. This feature dramatically speeds up data entry for frequently ordered items.

**Copy and Modify**: When adding multiple similar items, use the copy function to duplicate an existing item and modify only the differences. This is particularly useful for furniture sets or variations of the same basic design.

**Real-Time Preview**: As you make selections, the system provides a real-time preview of the item specifications and estimated pricing. This immediate feedback helps ensure accuracy and completeness.

**Mobile Optimization**: The visual selector works seamlessly on tablets and smartphones, allowing sales teams to capture requirements during customer meetings or site visits.

### Pricing Operations and Management

#### Individual Item Pricing

For each item in your Pre-Quotation, you can manage pricing at a granular level:

**Cost Entry**: Enter material, labor, and overhead costs based on manufacturing estimates. The system provides guidance and default values based on item specifications, but you can override these with actual quotes from suppliers or more detailed manufacturing analysis.

**Profit Margin Setting**: Set profit margins either as a percentage of cost or by entering the desired selling price directly. The system automatically calculates the corresponding values and shows the profit amount per unit and total profit for the quantity ordered.

**Bulk Operations**: When working with multiple items, you can apply pricing changes across all items simultaneously. This is useful when applying company-wide margin policies or adjusting for market conditions.

#### Document-Level Pricing Summary

The Pre-Quotation provides comprehensive pricing summaries that aggregate all item-level calculations:

**Total Cost Summary**: View total material costs, labor costs, overhead costs, and overall project cost. This summary helps manufacturing teams understand resource requirements and production planning.

**Selling Price Summary**: See total selling prices, total profit amounts, and overall profit margins for the entire project. This information is crucial for sales management and pricing approval processes.

**Profitability Analysis**: The system calculates overall profit margins and provides visual indicators for profitability levels. This helps ensure that quotations meet company profitability targets.

### Manufacturing Costing Workflow

#### Cost Estimation Process

When a Pre-Quotation moves to the "Submitted to Manufacturing" status, manufacturing teams receive notifications to begin detailed cost estimation:

**Specification Review**: Manufacturing teams review all specifications captured through the visual selector, ensuring they have complete information for accurate costing.

**Material Sourcing**: Teams can research current material costs, considering factors such as quality grades, supplier availability, and bulk purchase opportunities.

**Production Planning**: Estimate production time, equipment requirements, and labor allocation based on current capacity and scheduling.

**Quality Requirements**: Consider any special quality requirements, testing needs, or certification requirements that might affect costs.

#### Cost Entry and Validation

Manufacturing teams enter detailed cost information using the enhanced pricing interface:

**Material Cost Breakdown**: Enter costs for all materials required, including primary materials, hardware, finishes, and consumables. The system can store supplier information and track cost variations over time.

**Labor Time Estimation**: Calculate labor requirements based on production complexity, skill requirements, and current labor rates. Consider factors such as setup time, production time, finishing time, and quality control.

**Overhead Allocation**: Apply appropriate overhead rates based on company policies and current facility utilization. The system can automatically calculate overhead based on configurable percentages or allow manual entry for special circumstances.

**Cost Validation**: Review all cost components for accuracy and completeness. The system provides validation checks to ensure no critical cost elements are missed.

### Sales Team Pricing Tools

#### Quotation Preview and Generation

Before finalizing a Pre-Quotation, sales teams can generate professional quotation previews:

**Preview Generation**: The system creates a formatted quotation preview showing how the final quotation will appear to customers. This includes item descriptions, quantities, pricing, and terms.

**Pricing Validation**: Review all pricing components to ensure accuracy and competitiveness. The system can provide alerts if margins fall below company thresholds or if pricing appears inconsistent with market standards.

**Customer Communication**: Use the preview to discuss pricing with customers, making adjustments as needed before final approval.

#### Pricing Optimization Tools

The system includes several tools to help optimize pricing for maximum profitability:

**Margin Analysis**: Compare profit margins across different items and identify opportunities for optimization. The system can highlight items with unusually high or low margins for review.

**Competitive Pricing**: While not directly integrated with external pricing databases, the system provides frameworks for incorporating competitive analysis into pricing decisions.

**Volume Discounting**: Calculate and apply volume discounts based on quantity thresholds or total project value. The system can automatically adjust pricing based on configurable discount schedules.

**Currency Management**: For international customers, the system can handle multiple currencies and exchange rate considerations, though specific currency conversion features may require additional configuration.

### Advanced Pricing Features

#### Bulk Pricing Operations

When managing large quotations with many items, bulk operations significantly improve efficiency:

**Bulk Margin Application**: Apply the same profit margin percentage across all items in a quotation. This is useful when company policy requires consistent margins or when adjusting for market conditions.

**Bulk Cost Adjustments**: Apply percentage increases or decreases to material, labor, or overhead costs across multiple items. This helps when supplier costs change or when adjusting for inflation.

**Selective Bulk Operations**: Apply bulk changes to only selected items rather than all items in a quotation. This provides flexibility when different item categories require different treatment.

#### Cost Estimation Automation

The system includes intelligent cost estimation capabilities:

**Specification-Based Estimation**: The system can automatically estimate costs based on item specifications such as dimensions, materials, and complexity. These estimates serve as starting points for more detailed cost analysis.

**Historical Cost Analysis**: When available, the system can reference historical cost data for similar items to provide more accurate initial estimates.

**Supplier Integration**: With proper configuration, the system can integrate with supplier databases to obtain current material pricing automatically.

### Reporting and Analytics

#### Pricing Performance Reports

The enhanced system provides comprehensive reporting capabilities for pricing analysis:

**Margin Analysis Reports**: Track profit margins across different time periods, customers, item types, and sales representatives. Identify trends and opportunities for improvement.

**Cost Variance Reports**: Compare estimated costs with actual costs when available, helping improve future cost estimation accuracy.

**Pricing Trend Analysis**: Monitor how pricing changes over time, helping identify market trends and competitive positioning.

#### Conversion Tracking

Monitor how pricing affects conversion rates:

**Quote-to-Order Conversion**: Track which quotations convert to orders and analyze pricing factors that influence conversion rates.

**Competitive Analysis**: When quotations are lost to competitors, track pricing factors to improve future competitiveness.

**Customer Price Sensitivity**: Analyze customer responses to different pricing levels to optimize pricing strategies.

### Integration with ERPNext

#### Quotation Generation

When a Pre-Quotation is approved, the system seamlessly creates standard ERPNext Quotations:

**Automatic Item Creation**: The system creates ERPNext Items for all custom furniture pieces, including complete specifications and pricing information.

**Quotation Formatting**: Generate professional ERPNext Quotations with proper formatting, terms, and conditions.

**Customer Integration**: Ensure customer information is properly synchronized between the Pre-Quotation system and standard ERPNext customer records.
